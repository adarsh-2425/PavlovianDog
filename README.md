# PavlovianDog

The PavlovianDog class is a C++ implementation of the classical conditioning process for a dog, as described by Ivan Pavlov. The class allows you to set the conditioned stimulus, unconditioned response, and conditioned response for the dog, and simulates the conditioning process by outputting messages to the console.
